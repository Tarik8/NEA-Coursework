# NEA-Coursework

This my computer science courseowork by OCR. Since the coursework got leaked, the examination has been changed to 100% exam and 0% coursework. Therefore, I decided to make my own version of the coursework as it did not count.

I was given around a year, and I completed it in around 10 hours.

This program has more than 1000 lines of code which is probably the most in the entire country..
